        Well... this is it. The beginning of the #100 Days of Code Challenge
        for me. Over the next 100 days I will try to do a bit of programming
        everyday (I think the challenge is at least an hour per day).

      <p>
        Having finished freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification, I
        decided to start this webpage using Github Pages, where I will be
        applying my newly acquired skills. Well, actually I finished the Web
        Design Certification about 8 months ago, when we were on lockdown for
        the first time because of Covid-19. But, when lockdown was lifted, I
        went back to my regular job and almost didn't touch the subject again...
        until now. So, this will serve to refresh my memory on html and css as
        I add content and style to this webpage. At the same time I am
        following the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification,
        also on freeCodeCamp, but it seems that tutorials don't count for the
        Challenge.

        So, here I am publishing my own website. It will be my diary for the
        100 Days of code Challenge. It's still very "raw", this is only a very
        basic webpage minimal html and css elements to start. Over the next 100
        days I expect to add more content, a different style and functionality.

        And finally, a recollection of what I've done today. Basically I
        created an html file with the text you're reading and added a css to
        change the text font. The html is has a &lt;head&gt;, a &lt;body&gt;
        and a &lt;footer&gt;. The &lt;body&gt; part contains all this text and
        I already learned something new to me. How to write the html tags with
        the < (less than) and > (greater than) signs without messing with the
        code, by using escape characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's it for today. See you tomorrow!!
